# ICS3U Culminating Assignment

## Bicycle Safety Game

Made by Justin Jiang and Tsz Fei Wang
The purpose of this game is to teach the player the basics of bicycle safety. 
It has a learning portion where the game teaches the player in flashcard style what each symbol/safety item does.
Then, there is a maze in which the user has to collect all the symbols and answer questions about them.
Finally, there is a game where you have to use what you have learned to reach the final objective: a **__Pristine, Hand drawn blahaj with no flaws whatsoever__**.

This game is not legal/official information, however we, the authors, have tried our best to make everything as accurate to real life as possible.
That said, you do not get 3 lives after getting run over by a car.

## HOW TO RUN GAME
Open "Game.java" in Ready To Program IDE and click `Run` or use the shortcut `Ctrl + R` to run.
# Where do I find Ready to Program?
[Download](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/) the Ready 1.7.1 executable and run it.

## LINUX INSTRUCIONS
1. Download and install the Wine Emulator from your package manager of choice (Software center on Ubuntu is outdated)
2. Download the Ready to Program .exe file and move it to ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/'Program Files x86'
3. Run `wine ready171_install.exe`
4. Follow instructions on screen
5. When it asks you for an install location, make sure to put it somewhere in the .wine folder.
6. Run `wine ready.exe`
7. Note: USB devices are stored in `E:`. Your physical hard drive is in `Z:`
### Optional
For the monospaced fonts and console sizing to work properly:
1. Boot up a Windows VM (or go to a windows install) and navigate to `C:\Windows\Fonts`
2. Archive and move it to your Linux install however you like
3. Extract the archive to `~/.wine/drive_c/windows/Fonts/` (Thanks to [Creative0708](https://github.com/Creative0708) for this part)
The font should be working.
